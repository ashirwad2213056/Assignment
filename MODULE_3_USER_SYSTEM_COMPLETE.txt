# Module 3: User System - Completed & Verified

## implemented Features

### 1. Backend
- **User Controller**: Added `getUserProfile`, `updateUserProfile`, `getDashboard`, `deleteUserAccount`, and admin functions.
- **User Routes**: Protected routes with authentication middleware (`/profile`, `/dashboard`).
- **Data aggregation**: Dashboard endpoint returns user stats, registered events, and created events in a single call.
- **MongoDB Connection**: Updated connection options for compatibility. Confirmed server starts, though DB connection requires IP whitelist check.

### 2. Frontend Services
- **API Service**: Updated `api.js` to handle authentication tokens (JWT) and user-related API calls.
- **Auth Context**: Refactored `AuthContext` to separate Hook (`AuthContext.js`) and Provider (`AuthProvider.jsx`) to resolve HMR issues.
- **Route Protection**: Created `ProtectedRoute.jsx` component to safeguard private pages.

### 3. Pages & UI
- **Home**: Landing page with quick links to login/register.
- **Login/Register**: Full authentication forms with validation and error handling.
- **Dashboard**: Features personalized stats and event management.
- **Profile**: Allows users to update details, change password, and delete account.

## Fixes Applied
- **Vite HMR**: Resolved "Fast Refresh" error by splitting AuthContext.
- **Linting**: Fixed unused variables and fragment issues.
- **Backend Startup**: Verified backend serves API requests (Health: OK).

## Important Note
- **Database Connection**: The backend is running, but MongoDB Atlas is refusing connections due to IP Whitelisting. **Please ensure your current IP address is added to the MongoDB Atlas Network Access whitelist.**

## Next Steps (Module 4)
- Create Event Management features (Create, Update, Delete events)
- Implement Event Details page with registration logic
- Add Image Upload functionality
- Implement Search and Filtering
